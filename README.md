# Rayshomar – Blockchain API

### This repository is part of the Rayshomar online voting system and handles the blockchain integration layer. It consists of two main components:
- Solidity Smart Contracts – These contracts define the core logic for secure and transparent voting on the blockchain.
- Node.js & Express API – This service connects the main backend API of Rayshomar to the blockchain, exposing endpoints for interacting with the smart contracts from the frontend.

### This layer acts as a secure bridge between the main system and the blockchain network.
